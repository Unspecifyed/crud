In this project, the Dash framework for Python will be used to create an interactive dashboard for an animal shelter. The dashboard offers a range of features, including the ability to filter data according to breed and outcome type, present data in tabular form, and visualize desired animal breeds and geographic regions using interactive maps and charts.

The project consists of the following files:

    animal_shelter.py: Python script containing the AnimalShelter class to interact with the MongoDB database.
    dashboard.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the dashboard using Dash.
    logo.png: Logo image used in the dashboard.

Conditions

Make sure you have installed the following:

    3.x Python Jupyter Notebook
    Dash Leaflet Dash Plotly Pandas PyMongo (if utilizing MongoDB)

Configuration

    Make a local copy of the repository on your computer.
    Go to the project directory by navigating.
    Pip install -r requirements.txt can be used to install the necessary Python packages.

Use

    Make sure the project directory has the logo.png file. If not, edit the file path in the dashboard and replace it with the logo file of your choice.the ipynb file.
    Using Jupyter Notebook, open the dashboard.ipynb file.
    Launch the dashboard application by running the notebook cells. The default web browser should launch the dashboard.
    Utilize the drop-down choices to filter data according to breed and outcome type. Depending on the chosen filters, the data table, map, and charts will all change dynamically.
